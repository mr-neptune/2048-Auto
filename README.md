# 2048-Auto
2048 is a well known puzzle game, where the player will move number tiles in a 4*4 grid to merge the number 2048, or eve higher. The game logic is implemented in python3, and the user interface is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I used flask to create the virtual environment for the game to run, and this environment will also be used for training the agent on playing this game.
